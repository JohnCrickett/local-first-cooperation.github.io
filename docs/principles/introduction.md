title: The Five Principles
---

The following principles guide us towards creating IT systems that thrive on end-user hardware and stay maximally useful when internet access is limited:

- [communicate locally](communicate-locally.md)
- [build autonomous parts](autonomy.md)
- [design parts for cooperation](cooperation.md)
- [accept uncertainty when making decisions](accept-uncertainty.md)
- [foresee dynamic changes in the network neighbourhood](foresee-network-dynamics.md)

Building software according to these principles poses some challenges that are tackled by the following helpful techniques:

- [hierarchical systems to cover space and time](../techniques/hierarchical-systems.md)
- [employ scoped consistency only where required](../techniques/scoped-consensus.md)
- [communicate events, not state](../techniques/communicate-facts.md)
- [design the flow of information](../techniques/information-flow.md)
