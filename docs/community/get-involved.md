The endeavour outlined above is far greater than any single person or organisation who contributes.
If you want to help push this forward you are very welcome to join us:

- ask to join our [email group](https://groups.google.com/g/local-first-cooperation) (your address will only be visible to group admins if you use the web frontend for composing messages)
- review more material on this website and contribute to it [on github](https://github.com/local-first-cooperation/website)
- spread the word by forwarding this information to those who you think should contribute
