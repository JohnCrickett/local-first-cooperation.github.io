title: The plan
---

Our plan is to create and refine software tools that make it simple and easy to build resilient software according to the principles outlined above. This requires comprehensive documentation on the principles and how they shall be applied, and it will benefit greatly from promoting these ideas so that more people create suitable tools. We aim for a multitude of tools to grow that each cover some particular part of the problem or an application domain. By adhering to the above principles, the software that will be built on these tools will be able to cooperate on a much larger scale, between different implementations. Out of this experience may eventually emerge a set of communication standards, but we deliberately do not start from that end — we let nature run its course to find the optimal solution.
